# Loading System Implementation Documentation

## Overview
A comprehensive, bulletproof loading system has been implemented to ensure all game assets and data are fully loaded before the game starts, preventing runtime failures and improving user experience.

## Key Components

### 1. LoadingManager (`src/managers/LoadingManager.ts`)
The central loading orchestrator that manages all asset loading phases:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures single instance across the application
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates with percentage calculation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery and user feedback
- **Asset Caching**: Prevents duplicate loads and improves performance

#### Loading Phases:
1. **Host Communication** (15% weight)
   - Waits for audio settings from host
   - Establishes game-host connection
   
2. **Background Images** (20% weight)
   - Loads all 6 map backgrounds
   - Startup Lab, Innovasjon Norge, Skatteetaten, NAV, Kommunehuset, Alltinn

3. **Player Sprites** (15% weight)
   - Sigurd animations (idle, running, jumping, floating)
   - Ghost animations for special modes
   - Completion animations

4. **Monster Sprites** (10% weight)
   - All enemy types and their animations
   - Byråkrat-klonen, Hodeløs konsulent, Regel-robot, etc.

5. **UI Sprites** (10% weight)
   - Bombs, coins, and other UI elements

6. **Audio Files** (15% weight)
   - Background music
   - Sound effects

7. **Map Data** (10% weight)
   - Level definitions validation
   - Map configuration

8. **Finalization** (5% weight)
   - Final initialization steps

### 2. LoadingMenu Component (`src/components/menu/menus/LoadingMenu.tsx`)
Beautiful, animated loading screen with:

- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Animated spinning loader
  - Progress bar with color transitions
  - Percentage display
  - Dynamic loading messages

- **User Experience**:
  - Loading tips that rotate based on progress
  - Step descriptions for transparency
  - Error state with retry option
  - Smooth transitions

### 3. Integration Changes

#### MainGame Component Updates:
- Now shows LoadingMenu before rendering GameCanvas
- Prevents game initialization until loading complete
- Smooth transition from loading to game start

#### GameCanvas Updates:
- Removed internal loading state
- Simplified initialization (no async waiting)
- Cleaner component lifecycle

#### GameManager Updates:
- Removed audio settings wait (handled by LoadingManager)
- Changed `start()` from async to sync
- Cleaner initialization flow

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: No more game breaking due to missing assets
2. **User Experience**: Clear loading progress and feedback
3. **Performance**: Parallel asset loading where possible
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized loading logic
5. **Debugging**: Clear logging of loading steps
6. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failed loads

## Usage Flow

1. User opens the game
2. MainGame component renders LoadingMenu
3. LoadingManager starts loading process:
   - Shows progress for each phase
   - Updates messages dynamically
   - Handles errors gracefully
4. Once complete, LoadingMenu signals MainGame
5. MainGame renders GameCanvas and menus
6. Game is ready to play with all assets loaded

## Configuration

### Adding New Assets
To add new assets to the loading process:

1. Add to appropriate loading phase in LoadingManager
2. Update weight if needed for accurate progress
3. Add dynamic messages if desired

### Customizing Messages
Messages can be customized in:
- `LoadingManager.dynamicMessages` for variety
- `LoadingMenu.getStepDescription()` for step descriptions
- `LoadingMenu.getLoadingTip()` for loading tips

## Error Handling

The system handles errors at multiple levels:
1. Individual asset failures don't stop loading
2. Critical failures show error screen with retry
3. Timeout fallbacks for host communication
4. Detailed error logging for debugging

## Development Mode

In development mode with `DEV_CONFIG.SKIP_AUDIO_SETTINGS_WAIT`:
- Host communication step is skipped
- Faster development iteration
- All other loading phases remain active

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Asset preloading prioritization
2. Progressive loading for faster initial display
3. Cache persistence across sessions
4. Loading progress analytics
5. A/B testing different loading messages
